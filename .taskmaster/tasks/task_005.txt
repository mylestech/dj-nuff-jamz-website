# Task ID: 5
# Title: Configure MongoDB Database and Data Models
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up MongoDB database and implement the required data models for booking requests, music catalog, and gallery items.
# Details:
1. Set up MongoDB Atlas cluster or local MongoDB instance
2. Create database schemas for the three data models:
   - Booking Requests: clientInfo, eventDetails, requirements, status
   - Music Catalog: mixId, title, genre, duration, audioUrl, uploadDate, playCount, featured
   - Gallery Items: imageId, title, eventType, venue, date, imageUrl, thumbnailUrl, featured
3. Implement Mongoose models and validation
4. Create database connection module
5. Set up indexes for performance optimization
6. Implement CRUD operations for each model
7. Create seed data for development

# Test Strategy:
Test database connection and CRUD operations for each model. Validate schema constraints with edge case inputs. Verify indexing performance with query analysis. Test data integrity with concurrent operations.
