# DJ Nuff Jamz Website - Backup Strategy

## Overview
Comprehensive backup strategy for JAMstack architecture hosted on Vercel with Git as the primary source of truth.

## Current Architecture
- **Static Site**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript hosted on Vercel
- **Source Control**: Git repository on GitHub
- **Deployment**: Automatic deployment from Git via Vercel
- **Domain**: djnuffjamz.com and nuffjamz.com with SSL
- **CDN**: Vercel Edge Network with global distribution

## Backup Layers

### 1. Primary Backup: Git Repository âœ…
- **Location**: https://github.com/mylestech/dj-nuff-jamz-website.git
- **Frequency**: Every commit (manual/automatic)
- **Retention**: Unlimited (Git history)
- **Recovery Time**: Immediate (git clone/pull)

### 2. Vercel Deployment History âœ…
- **Location**: Vercel platform
- **Frequency**: Every deployment (automatic)
- **Retention**: Vercel's standard retention policy
- **Recovery Time**: Immediate (rollback via Vercel dashboard)

### 3. Additional Git Remote Mirrors ðŸ”„
- **Purpose**: Redundancy for Git repository
- **Locations**: Multiple Git hosting providers
- **Frequency**: Automatic sync with primary repository
- **Recovery Time**: Immediate

### 4. Local Development Backup ðŸ”„
- **Purpose**: Developer machine backup
- **Location**: Local development environment
- **Frequency**: Continuous (during development)
- **Recovery Time**: Immediate

## Backup Procedures

### Daily Automated Backup
Since this is a static site with Git as source of truth:
1. **Git commits** serve as incremental backups
2. **Vercel deployments** create deployment snapshots
3. **Git remote mirrors** provide redundancy

### Manual Backup Process
```bash
# 1. Ensure all changes are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Backup: $(date)"

# 2. Push to primary remote
git push origin main

# 3. Push to backup remotes (when configured)
git push backup main
git push mirror main
```

### Restoration Procedures

#### From Git Repository
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/mylestech/dj-nuff-jamz-website.git

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Build project
npm run build

# 4. Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

#### From Vercel Deployment History
1. Log into Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to project deployments
3. Select desired deployment
4. Click "Promote to Production"

## Backup Verification

### Weekly Verification Tasks
- [ ] Verify Git repository accessibility
- [ ] Check Vercel deployment history
- [ ] Test restoration from Git clone
- [ ] Verify backup remote synchronization

### Monthly Verification Tasks
- [ ] Full restoration test in clean environment
- [ ] Verify all backup remotes are synchronized
- [ ] Review backup retention policies
- [ ] Update backup documentation

## Future Database Integration

When databases are added to the project:

### Database Backup Strategy
1. **MongoDB Atlas**: Automatic backups (if using Atlas)
2. **Custom Database**: Daily automated dumps
3. **Backup Storage**: Encrypted offsite storage
4. **Retention**: 30 daily, 12 monthly, 7 yearly

### Database Backup Scripts
```bash
# MongoDB backup script (future implementation)
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
mongodump --uri="$MONGODB_URI" --out="backups/db_backup_$DATE"
```

## Security Considerations

### Backup Security
- Git repositories use HTTPS/SSH authentication
- Vercel deployments secured by platform authentication
- Future database backups will be encrypted
- Access logs maintained for audit trails

### Access Control
- Repository access limited to authorized developers
- Vercel project access controlled by team permissions
- Backup restoration requires proper authentication

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Current Monitoring
- Git repository health (GitHub status)
- Vercel deployment status (automatic notifications)
- Domain SSL certificate monitoring (automatic renewal)

### Future Monitoring
- Database backup success/failure alerts
- Backup verification test results
- Storage usage monitoring for backup retention

## Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)

| Scenario | Recovery Time | Method |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Code rollback | < 5 minutes | Vercel deployment rollback |
| Full site restoration | < 15 minutes | Git clone + Vercel deploy |
| Domain/DNS issues | < 30 minutes | DNS configuration restore |
| Complete infrastructure loss | < 1 hour | Full rebuild from Git |

## Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

| Data Type | Maximum Data Loss | Backup Frequency |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Source code | 0 (with proper Git workflow) | Every commit |
| Deployed site | < 1 hour | Every deployment |
| Configuration | 0 | Stored in Git |

## Backup Costs

### Current Costs
- **Git Repository**: Free (GitHub)
- **Vercel Deployments**: Included in hosting plan
- **Domain/SSL**: Included in Vercel plan

### Future Costs (with database)
- **Database Backups**: Varies by provider
- **Offsite Storage**: ~$5-20/month depending on data size
- **Monitoring Tools**: ~$10-50/month

## Implementation Status

- [x] Git repository backup (primary)
- [x] Vercel deployment history (automatic)
- [ ] Additional Git remote mirrors
- [ ] Backup verification scripts
- [ ] Automated backup monitoring
- [ ] Documentation completion
- [ ] Restoration testing

## Maintenance Schedule

### Weekly
- Verify backup systems are functioning
- Check Git repository synchronization
- Review recent deployments

### Monthly
- Test full restoration procedure
- Review backup retention policies
- Update backup documentation

### Quarterly
- Disaster recovery drill
- Review and update backup strategy
- Audit access controls and security
